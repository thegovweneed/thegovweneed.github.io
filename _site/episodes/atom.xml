&lt;p&gt;By identifying the right problems to work on — and solving these with a performance and purpose-based mindset — government can better serve its true mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Peak Performance” author Brian Elms thinks government should be constantly asking itself questions like, “Should we be doing this at all? Are we the ones that should be doing it? If not, can we stop doing it? Can we figure out a way to get better at all these things?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Denver Mayor Michael Hancock said he wanted train city employees how to spot and fix inefficiencies in their work, Brian is the person he asked to do it. The training operation he built, called Peak Academy, quickly became a fixture in Denver City Hall — it’s trained about 7,000 employees in seven years, and saved the city close to $30 million by identifying and eliminating wasteful work in the daily lives of government employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initiative was so successful that other cities, states, and counties began adopting the model, and many have even made “Peak Performance” required reading. Brian now works with the Change and Innovation Agency, leading innovation academies all over the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian talks with The Government We Need about how government can ask the right questions and, by doing so, find its true public service purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

There are numerous, well-documented cases of public sector mishandling of technology projects, from the very public failed launch of Healthcare.gov to the many unseen, ineffective IT implementations that occur on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decade ago, a movement of civic hackers — technologists working for good — inside and outside government began to eschew the trappings of Silicon Valley technology culture, instead putting their talents to use to code a better civil society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Jen Pahlka started Code for America, a nonprofit dedicated to bringing a delivery-driven, digital mindset to government. Jen also served as deputy chief technology officer in the Obama Administration and played an instrumental role in the creation of the federal government’s U.S. Digital Service, whose mission it is “to deliver better government services to the American people through technology and design.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jen talks with The Government We Need about how we all can code a better government.&lt;/p&gt;

Many of them have been historically underrepresented in public leadership. With the support of organizations like Run for Something, fresh faces are getting elected to serve the communities and causes they care about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this episode of The Government We Need, we talk with Sarah Horvitz, National Political Director of Run for Something. Sarah ran for an elected position on her local school board while she was still a high school student, and she won! She became passionate about ensuring that our public institutions are reflective of the people they govern, and went on to support several political races in California. She served as the Deputy Organizing Director for Hillary Clinton’s Virginia team, along with working for her campaign in the Iowa caucuses and 3 state primaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does diversity in government look like, and what impact can it have on society? How can younger candidates find opportunities to run and get elected into public office? Who are the successful candidates that have gone on to serve their communities and pave the way for a more diverse and inclusive government?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We explore these questions and more in this episode.&lt;/p&gt;

In the early days, this was OK, but today the landscape is more complicated because, in the internet+ era, nearly everything is connected to the internet. A spreadsheet crashes, and you lose your data. A heart device crashes, and you lose your life. Both are computers, maybe connected to the same CPU or operating system. The only difference is that the computers are attached to different things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this episode of The Government We Need, we interview Bruce Schneier, an American cryptographer, computer security professional, privacy specialist and writer. Bruce is a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet &amp;amp; Society at Harvard University and a lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. His influential newsletter “Crypto-Gram” and his blog “Schneier on Security” are read by over 250,000 people. He is the author of over one dozen books — including his latest, Click Here to Kill Everybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government has a duty of care that private companies do not. The free market doesn’t reward safety and security, so the government must step in. The government regulates stuff that kills people, and now the internet is one of those things, so the question is what does the government need to do to effectively regulate the internet+ world and keep us safe?&lt;/p&gt;
